I decided to set up this blog mainly as an experiment.

I might write migth write some Python and software dev related posts sometime
soon.

This blog is powered by `Pelican`_, the posts are written in
`reStructuredText`_ and it's hosted on `Github Pages`_.

I'm keeping the `source repository`_ separate from the
`Github Pages repository`_ where the generated files are stored.
