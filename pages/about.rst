I'm an Israeli Software developer, I've had experience with multiple
programming languages, and in several fields, but in the past couple
of years, I proudly call myself a "Python Developer".

I love building web applications with `Django`_ (and sometimes `Flask`_
or `Pyramid`_), and building various back-end services.
I also have hands-on experience with Java and PHP, but prefer to avoid
them when possible.

I'm employed full-time at a company you probably never heard of, but have
plenty of time to work on side-projects and things I find interesting.

I'm almost always available for consulting work, if interested, drop me a line.

You can contact me about anything, at <anything>@yprez.com.
